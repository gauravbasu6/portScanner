# portScanner
Basic portScanner for my Quark Summer Technical Project. Used python-nmap module.
--> Scan top 1000 ports (0-1000)
--> Scan all 65536 ports (0-65535)
The script returns which ports are open, alongwith the service names.

## Requirements

Also, python-nmap module is required, which can be installed using the terminal command <br>
pip3 install python-nmap

## How to Use

  python3 PortScanner.py <br>
